## Context

Implement the pacing primitives (beat, breath, wait) in the M facade. These control the rhythm of a video by inserting silence segments into the timeline.

From the spec:
- `m.beat()` — short pause (~0.3s). A breath between thoughts.
- `m.breath()` — medium pause (~0.8s). A transition between sections.
- `m.wait(duration)` — explicit pause of given duration in seconds.

These methods should add Silence segments to the timeline. They affect both the visual timeline (frames of still) and the audio track (silence).

Files: moron-core/src/facade.rs, moron-core/src/timeline.rs (if modifications needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- m.beat() adds ~0.3s silence segment to timeline
- m.breath() adds ~0.8s silence segment to timeline
- m.wait(2.0) adds 2.0s silence segment
- Default durations are constants that can be configured
- `cargo test` passes
- Unit tests: verify correct durations added to timeline
