## Context

Rendering 1000 frames takes ~33 seconds. Before optimizing, we need to know where the time goes. The pipeline has several stages: frame state computation (pure Rust), JSON serialization, Chrome page evaluation (sending JSON + executing React render), screenshot capture, and PNG write to disk.

Instrument the pipeline to produce a per-stage timing breakdown. The output of this ticket drives the prioritization of T-010-02 and T-010-03.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Add optional timing instrumentation to `render()` in renderer.rs
- Produce a breakdown: computation time, Chrome capture time, I/O time per frame
- Run against what-is-moron scene (or DemoScene scaled to 1000 frames) and report results
- Identify which stage accounts for >50% of wall-clock time
- Document findings in work artifact (no code changes required beyond instrumentation)
