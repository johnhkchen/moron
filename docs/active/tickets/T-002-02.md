## Context

Define the `Technique` trait and easing system in moron-techniques. Techniques are the building blocks of animation — FadeIn, Stagger, etc. They need a composable design where techniques can be combined (e.g., `Stagger(FadeUp.with_ease(Ease::OutBack))`).

Define:
- `Technique` trait with a method to apply the technique
- `Ease` enum with common easing curves (Linear, EaseIn, EaseOut, EaseInOut, OutBack, OutBounce, Spring)
- `WithEase` combinator — wraps a technique with an easing curve
- Stub technique structs in their respective modules: FadeIn, FadeUp in reveals.rs; Slide, Scale in motion.rs; Stagger in staging.rs; CountUp in data.rs
- Each technique struct should implement the Technique trait (with `todo!()` bodies)

Files: moron-techniques/src/technique.rs, moron-techniques/src/reveals.rs, moron-techniques/src/motion.rs, moron-techniques/src/staging.rs, moron-techniques/src/data.rs, moron-techniques/src/lib.rs

## Acceptance Criteria

- `Technique` trait defined
- `Ease` enum with 7+ variants
- `WithEase<T: Technique>` combinator defined
- At least 6 stub technique structs implementing Technique
- `Stagger(FadeUp.with_ease(Ease::OutBack))` compiles (composition works)
- `cargo check` passes
- Unit test: verify technique composition type-checks
