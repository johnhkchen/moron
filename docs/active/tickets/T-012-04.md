## Context

With the pacing system in place, update the what-is-moron scene to use `m.hold()` instead of manual `beat()` / `breath()` calls. Verify the result feels comfortable at 1x playback speed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Replace `beat()` and `breath()` in WhatIsMoronScene with `hold()` or `hold_for()` as appropriate
- Title slides: short hold (~1s)
- Content slides: hold scales with visible text
- Stagger slides: hold accounts for stagger duration + reading time
- Metric slide: hold for dramatic pause (2s+)
- Total duration remains in 25-45s range
- Subjective test: watch at 1x speed, every slide readable without pausing
- Tests updated to reflect new segment structure
