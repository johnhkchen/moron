## Context

Individual element renderers in MoronFrame are functional but plain:

- **Steps**: plain text lines with no visual structure (no numbers, bullets, or icons)
- **Metric**: value and label stacked but no visual emphasis or animation-friendly styling
- **Show**: basic paragraph, no max-width constraint for readability
- **Section**: looks similar to body text, needs stronger visual weight

## Acceptance Criteria

- Steps items: numbered or bulleted with subtle leading indicator, left-aligned with consistent indentation
- Metric value: extra-large font, accent color, clear visual weight over the label
- Show text: max-width constraint (~60ch) for comfortable reading, centered
- Section header: accent underline or left-border, clearly distinct from body text
- All renderers use theme tokens (no hardcoded colors)
- Items within Steps have individual opacity/transform applied (already wired from T-009-02)
- Visual regression: no broken layouts at 1920x1080
