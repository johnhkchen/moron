## Context

Auto-hold provides good defaults but scene authors need control. Some slides should hold longer for dramatic effect. Others should move quickly. The API should support explicit overrides while keeping auto-hold as the easy default.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `m.hold()` — auto-computed reading time (from T-012-02)
- `m.hold_for(duration)` — explicit hold duration override
- `m.hold_extra(duration)` — auto-computed + additional time
- Configurable reading speed: `m.set_reading_speed(wpm)` adjusts the model globally
- `m.set_min_hold(duration)` — set floor for auto-hold
- All hold variants record as Silence segments on the timeline
- Tests verify each API variant produces expected durations
- Backward compatible: scenes using beat/breath still work unchanged
