## Context

Replace the word-count-based duration estimation in `m.narrate()` with actual TTS durations. Currently, narration duration is estimated at 150 WPM. With real TTS, the duration comes from the synthesized audio clip.

This requires a two-pass approach:
1. First pass: scene builds, narrate() records text (duration TBD)
2. TTS pass: synthesize all narration segments, get actual durations
3. Timeline rebuild: update segment durations with real audio lengths

The M facade needs to support deferred duration resolution. The timeline's total duration and all frame timing will shift based on actual TTS output.

Files: moron-core/src/facade.rs (modify narrate flow), moron-core/src/timeline.rs (support duration updates)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Narration segment durations reflect actual TTS audio length
- Timeline total duration updates after TTS synthesis
- Frame timing adjusts to match real audio pacing
- Fallback to word-count estimation when TTS is unavailable
- Unit tests for duration resolution
- `cargo check` passes
