## Context

With animation execution (T-009-01), per-item Stagger support (T-009-02), and element layout (T-009-03) in place, the engine can produce real animated motion graphics. This ticket authors a polished "What is moron?" explainer video that exercises all these capabilities and serves as the project's first showcase.

The current `WhatIsMoronScene` in `moron-core/src/what_is_moron.rs` was written before animations or layout worked — it's a static slide deck. This ticket replaces it with a scene that demonstrates what moron can actually do.

### Scene outline (draft — refine during design phase)

1. **Cold open** — Title "What is moron?" fades in, holds, then clears
2. **The problem** — Section header slides in from left, then three pain points stagger in with FadeUp+OutBack
3. **The solution** — "Write → Build → Watch" three-step workflow with staggered reveal
4. **Key differentiators** — Bullets stagger in: offline, open source, LLM-friendly
5. **The metric** — "< 15K lines of code" with CountUp animation and scale pop
6. **Closing** — "moron" title fades in, tagline below, holds

### What this ticket validates

- Animations visually execute (not just affect pacing)
- Stagger animates items one-by-one
- Layout positions elements correctly on multi-element slides
- clear() produces clean slide transitions
- The video looks like a real explainer, not a debug test

## Acceptance Criteria

- `WhatIsMoronScene` rewritten to use animations, stagger, layout, and pacing effectively
- Built video (`moron build --scene what-is-moron`) produces a visually polished MP4
- No overlapping/unreadable text on any frame
- Animations are visible (elements fade/slide/scale, not just pop in)
- Stagger reveals bullets sequentially
- Scene exercises at least 4 different techniques (FadeIn, FadeUp, Stagger, CountUp)
- Total duration is 20-40 seconds at a comfortable pace
- Tests verify scene builds without panic and has expected structure
