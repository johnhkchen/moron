## Context

Current pacing uses fixed durations: `beat()` = 0.3s, `breath()` = 0.8s. These don't account for how much text is on screen. A slide with three bullet points needs more reading time than a single title, but both get the same pause.

This ticket defines a reading-time model that maps visible content to minimum hold duration. The model should handle different element types differently — titles are glanceable, body text needs actual reading time, bullet lists scale with item count.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Define reading speed constants: words-per-minute for body text, fixed hold for titles
- Model function: `reading_time(elements: &[ElementState]) -> f64` returns recommended hold in seconds
- Title/Section: short fixed hold (0.8-1.2s) — these are glanceable
- Show/body text: WPM-based (200 WPM reading speed, minimum 1.5s)
- Steps: per-item time (0.8-1.0s per item) plus base
- Metric: fixed hold (1.5-2.0s) for the "wow" moment
- Minimum hold floor: 0.5s (nothing should flash by)
- Unit tests with representative content verifying expected durations
