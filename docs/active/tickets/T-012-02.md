## Context

Scene authors currently manage pacing manually with `beat()` and `breath()`. This requires guessing how long each slide needs. With the reading-time model from T-012-01, we can automatically insert appropriate holds after content creation.

The key insight: after an animation completes and content is fully visible, the scene should hold long enough for the audience to read what's on screen before moving on.

## Acceptance Criteria

- New method `m.hold()` that computes reading time from currently visible elements and inserts a Silence segment of that duration
- `m.hold()` uses the reading-time model from T-012-01
- If called after `play()`, accounts for the animation duration (content is readable only after animation completes)
- `m.hold()` can replace most `beat()` and `breath()` calls in scenes
- Existing `beat()` and `breath()` remain unchanged (backward compatible)
- Tests verify `hold()` produces different durations for different content
