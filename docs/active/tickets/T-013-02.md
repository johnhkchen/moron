## Context

With `ElementKind::Data` carrying a component type identifier and JSON payload, the React layer needs a registry that maps component names to React components. Scene authors (or their build tooling) register custom components before rendering begins.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Component registry: `Map<string, React.ComponentType<DataComponentProps>>` where `DataComponentProps` includes the JSON payload, element state, and theme
- Registration API: `registerComponent(name: string, component)` called before render
- MoronFrame looks up Data elements in the registry and renders the matched component
- Unregistered component types render a visible fallback with the component name
- Registry is module-scoped (not global) — passed via React context or props
- TypeScript types exported for `DataComponentProps` so third-party components can type-check
- Tests verify registration, lookup, fallback, and rendering
