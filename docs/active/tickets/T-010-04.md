## Context

With parallel frame computation (T-010-02) and concurrent frame capture (T-010-03) in place, this ticket validates the combined improvements with end-to-end benchmarks and output equivalence checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmark script that renders what-is-moron at 1080p and reports wall-clock time
- Compare: sequential baseline vs parallel computation vs concurrent capture vs both
- Report improvement factor (e.g., "3.2x faster with 8 concurrent pages")
- Verify output equivalence: final MP4 from parallel pipeline matches sequential pipeline (frame-by-frame PNG comparison or video hash)
- Document results and recommended default concurrency in work artifact
- No regressions in existing test suite
