## Context

The component registry (T-013-02) allows custom React components, but integrating heavy ecosystem libraries (D3, Mapbox GL, deck.gl, recharts) requires guidance: how to structure the component, handle the data payload, respond to animation progress, and manage library lifecycle within moron's single-frame-render model.

Key constraint: MoronFrame renders one frame at a time (no animation loop). Libraries that expect a continuous render loop need adaptation — they should render a single state snapshot from the JSON payload and animation progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Integration guide document: how to write a moron-compatible data component using D3/Mapbox/etc.
- Helper utilities: `useDataPayload<T>(props)` hook that parses and types the JSON payload
- Progress-aware rendering: components receive animation progress (0-1) for interpolation
- Example component: simple bar chart using SVG (no external deps) demonstrating the pattern
- Example component: simple map outline using SVG demonstrating spatial data pattern
- Both examples registered, renderable, and tested in the component registry
