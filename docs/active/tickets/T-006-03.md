## Context

Wire TTS-generated audio into the `build_video()` pipeline. Currently, `assemble_audio_track()` produces silence for all segments. With the Kokoro backend, narration segments should use real synthesized speech.

The pipeline flow becomes:
1. Build scene → collect narration texts
2. Synthesize speech for each narration segment via Kokoro
3. Assemble audio track: real speech for narrations, silence for gaps
4. Render frames (timing now matches TTS durations)
5. Encode video, mux with real audio

Files: moron-core/src/build.rs (extend pipeline), moron-core/src/ffmpeg.rs (extend audio assembly)

## Acceptance Criteria

- build_video() uses TTS audio for narration segments
- Final .mp4 has audible speech matching narration text
- Graceful fallback to silence when TTS model is unavailable
- Audio and video durations match
- `cargo check` passes
