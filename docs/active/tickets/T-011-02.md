## Context

The current layout system positions elements by count (1→center, 2→upper/lower, 3+→evenly spaced). This works mechanically but doesn't produce slide-quality compositions. Different slide types need different layouts:

- **Title card**: centered vertically with generous whitespace
- **Section + bullets**: header at top third, bullets left-aligned with indentation
- **Metric hero**: large number centered, label below, dramatic whitespace
- **Closing**: centered with tagline below

## Acceptance Criteria

- Layout system recognizes common slide compositions and applies purpose-built positioning
- Title-only slides: element centered with slight upward bias (0.45) for visual balance
- Section + Steps: header at 0.25, steps starting at 0.45 with tighter vertical rhythm
- Metric slides: metric centered with extra scale emphasis in positioning
- Closing slides (title + show): stacked at center with controlled gap
- Layouts degrade gracefully for unexpected compositions (fall back to current even-spacing)
- Tests verify layout positions for each template pattern
