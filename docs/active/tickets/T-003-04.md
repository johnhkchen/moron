## Context

Write integration tests that verify the timeline and technique systems work together. Test the full flow: construct an M, call methods (title, narrate stubs, play techniques, pacing), and verify the resulting timeline has the expected segments and durations.

Tests should cover:
- Building a simple scene produces a valid timeline
- Techniques compose correctly (Stagger wrapping FadeUp with easing)
- Pacing primitives insert correct silence durations
- Timeline frame mapping is accurate at 30fps and 60fps
- Multiple scenes produce independent timelines

Files: moron-core/tests/integration.rs (new test file), moron-techniques/tests/composition.rs (new test file)

## Acceptance Criteria

- At least 5 integration tests
- Tests exercise M facade -> timeline -> technique pipeline
- Tests verify frame counts at different FPS
- All tests pass with `cargo test`
- No compilation warnings
