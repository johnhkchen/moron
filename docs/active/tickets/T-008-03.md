## Context

The CLI in `moron-cli/src/main.rs` defines three commands that only print "not yet implemented":

- `moron preview` (line ~77-79)
- `moron init` (line ~80-83)
- `moron gallery` (line ~84-86)

These create a false impression of functionality. Since these features don't exist yet, the commands should be removed from the CLI enum entirely. They can be re-added when actually implemented.

Relevant file: `moron-cli/src/main.rs`

## Acceptance Criteria

- `Preview`, `Init`, and `Gallery` variants removed from the `Commands` enum
- Associated match arms removed
- `moron --help` only shows `build` as a subcommand
- `cargo test` passes
- `cargo clippy` clean
