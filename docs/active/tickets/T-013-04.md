## Context

With the data pipeline, component registry, and ecosystem integration pattern in place, this ticket authors a proof-of-concept data-driven scene. The scene should demonstrate what moron can do beyond text slides — animated data that tells a story.

Candidate: A historical/geographic visualization (e.g., animated map showing territorial changes, or an animated chart showing growth over time). The specific subject is flexible — what matters is demonstrating the data→component→animation pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- New scene struct implementing `Scene` trait (e.g., `DataDemoScene`)
- Uses `m.data()` to pass structured data payloads to custom React components
- At least one data visualization that animates over time (using technique progress)
- Narration accompanies the visualization
- Scene registered in CLI (`--scene data-demo`)
- Built video produces a visually compelling data-driven explainer
- Tests verify scene builds without panic and produces expected element structure
- Demonstrates that moron can go beyond text slides into rich data storytelling
