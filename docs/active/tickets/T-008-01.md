## Context

`AudioClip::append()` and `AudioClip::concat()` in `moron-voice/src/audio.rs` use `assert_eq!` macros to validate sample rate and channel count compatibility. This causes panics in production code with no way for callers to recover gracefully.

The functions document the panic behavior with `# Panics` doc comments, but the API should return `Result` instead so callers can handle mismatched audio gracefully.

Relevant code:
- `moron-voice/src/audio.rs` lines 50-59 (`append`) and 74-85 (`concat`)
- Existing panic tests at lines 181-197

## Acceptance Criteria

- `AudioClip::append()` returns `Result<(), AudioError>` instead of panicking
- `AudioClip::concat()` returns `Result<AudioClip, AudioError>` instead of panicking
- New `AudioError` enum with variants for sample rate mismatch and channel count mismatch
- All call sites updated to propagate or handle the error
- Existing panic tests converted to error assertion tests
- `cargo test` passes in moron-voice and moron-core (build.rs uses these functions)
- `cargo clippy` clean
