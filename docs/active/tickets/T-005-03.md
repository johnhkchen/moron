## Context

Wire the full rendering pipeline into the `moron build` CLI command. The command takes a scene, builds it, renders frames, encodes video, and outputs .mp4.

Pipeline: scene file → M facade → timeline → frame rendering → FFmpeg encoding → .mp4

For this initial version, scenes are compiled into the binary (not dynamically loaded .rs files). The CLI demonstrates the full pipeline with a built-in demo scene.

Files: moron-cli/src/main.rs (implement Build command)

## Acceptance Criteria

- `moron build` runs the full pipeline and produces an .mp4
- Uses a built-in demo scene (hardcoded for now)
- Reports progress (rendering frame N/M, encoding, done)
- Output file is a valid .mp4 playable in standard video players
- Handles errors gracefully (missing Chrome, missing FFmpeg)
