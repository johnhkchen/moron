## Context

Create the base React component that renders a single frame from serialized FrameState JSON. This is the `<MoronFrame>` component in `packages/ui/`.

The component receives FrameState as props and renders:
- A container with theme CSS custom properties applied
- Each visible element positioned with CSS transforms matching TechniqueOutput (opacity, translateX/Y, scale, rotate)
- Text content rendered with theme typography
- Correct z-ordering based on element creation order

This is a minimal rendering component — not a polished template. It proves that Rust frame state can drive React rendering. Polished templates come later.

Files: packages/ui/src/MoronFrame.tsx (new), packages/ui/src/index.ts, packages/ui/package.json

## Acceptance Criteria

- `<MoronFrame>` component accepts FrameState as JSON props
- Renders elements with correct CSS transforms (opacity, translate, scale, rotation)
- Applies theme CSS custom properties to container
- Renders text content (title, section, metric, steps, show)
- Visual output matches the frame state data
- Component renders without errors in a browser/Node environment
