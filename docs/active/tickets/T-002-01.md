## Context

Define the `Scene` trait and `M` facade struct in moron-core. The Scene trait is what scene files implement — it has a single `build(m: &mut M)` method. The M struct is the facade that hides all internal machinery (Bevy ECS, renderer, timeline, FFmpeg, TTS) behind a clean API.

Key M method signatures to define (as stubs that compile):
- `m.narrate(text: &str)` — TTS narration
- `m.show(text: &str)` — context-aware text display
- `m.title(text: &str)`, `m.section(text: &str)` — structural elements
- `m.metric(label: &str, value: &str, direction: Direction)` — stat display
- `m.steps(items: &[&str])` — staggered reveal
- `m.beat()`, `m.breath()`, `m.wait(duration: f64)` — pacing
- `m.play(technique: impl Technique)` — execute animation
- `m.theme(theme: Theme)`, `m.voice(voice: Voice)` — configuration

Also define supporting types: `Direction` enum (Up/Down/Neutral), `Element` handle type.

Files: moron-core/src/facade.rs, moron-core/src/lib.rs

## Acceptance Criteria

- `Scene` trait defined with `fn build(m: &mut M)` method
- `M` struct defined with all method signatures listed above
- `Direction` enum defined
- Methods compile (can use `todo!()` bodies)
- `cargo check` passes
- Unit test: can construct an M and call at least one method
