## Context

Assemble an audio track from the timeline's segments and mux it with the video. For now, narration segments produce silence of the correct duration (actual TTS comes later). The audio track ensures the video has the correct total duration with an audio stream.

The audio assembly:
1. Walks the timeline segments
2. For each Narration segment: placeholder silence of the estimated duration (TTS integration is a future story)
3. For each Silence segment: silence of that duration
4. Concatenates into a single audio file (WAV or raw PCM)
5. FFmpeg muxes the audio track with the video track

Files: moron-core/src/ffmpeg.rs (extend with audio muxing), moron-voice/src/audio.rs (extend with audio assembly)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Can generate a silent audio track matching the timeline's total duration
- FFmpeg muxes audio + video into a single .mp4
- Output .mp4 has both video and audio streams
- Audio duration matches video duration
- `cargo check` passes
