## Context

MoronFrame uses flat backgrounds (`--moron-bg-primary`) and plain text with minimal hierarchy. Professional explainer videos use subtle gradients, accent colors for emphasis, and a clear typographic scale that guides the eye.

This ticket upgrades the base visual layer: background treatment, accent usage, and typographic refinement. Changes live in the React component and CSS custom properties — no Rust changes needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Background: subtle radial or linear gradient instead of flat color (using theme tokens)
- Accent color applied to section headers and metric values
- Typographic scale: title >> section >> body >> caption, with clear visual distinction
- Spacing rhythm: consistent vertical padding between element kinds
- All changes use `--moron-*` CSS custom properties (theme-switchable)
- Both moron-dark and moron-light themes look polished with the new treatments
- No layout shifts or text overflow at 1920x1080
