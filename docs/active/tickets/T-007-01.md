## Context

Define the template system architecture: how templates register, receive FrameState data, and compose with the rendering pipeline. Also build the host HTML page with a bundler so the Chromium bridge has a real page to load.

Currently, MoronFrame is a single component that renders all element types inline. Templates are a higher-level abstraction: named layouts (e.g., "explainer", "comparison", "data-story") that compose the base components with polished styling.

The host HTML page is the entry point loaded by ChromiumBridge. It needs to:
1. Bundle React + MoronFrame + templates into a single HTML file
2. Expose `window.__moron_setFrame(frameState)` for the Chromium bridge
3. Be buildable via a simple npm script

Files: packages/ui/src/templates/ (new directory), packages/ui/src/host.tsx (new), packages/ui/package.json (add build script)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Template registration system (name → component mapping)
- Host HTML page that loads React and exposes __moron_setFrame
- Build script produces a self-contained index.html
- ChromiumBridge can load the built page and render frames
- Template API documented in types
- `npm run build` produces working output
