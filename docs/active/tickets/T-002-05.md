## Context

Wire the types defined in T-002-01 through T-002-04 together through the M facade in moron-core. The M struct needs to hold references/state for the theme, voice config, and technique dispatch. The CLI should be able to construct an M and demonstrate type connectivity.

This ticket integrates the work from all four previous tickets:
- M stores a Theme (from moron-themes)
- M stores a Voice config (from moron-voice)
- M.play() accepts impl Technique (from moron-techniques)
- M.theme() and M.voice() set configuration
- moron-core re-exports key types in a `prelude` module

Files: moron-core/src/facade.rs, moron-core/src/lib.rs (add prelude module), moron-cli/src/main.rs (optional: demonstrate construction)

## Acceptance Criteria

- M struct stores Theme and Voice configuration
- M.play() accepts any Technique implementor
- moron-core has a `prelude` module re-exporting Scene, M, Theme, Voice, Technique, Ease, Direction
- `cargo check` passes across the full workspace
- Integration test: construct M with default theme/voice, call multiple methods
