## Data Visualization and Complex Scenes

moron currently renders text-centric slides: titles, bullets, metrics. But the most compelling explainer videos are data-driven — animated maps, charts, timelines with spatial data. Think "see the Allied advance into Germany" with a map that progressively fills, annotated with dates and troop counts.

The TypeScript/React ecosystem has world-class data visualization libraries (D3, Mapbox GL, deck.gl, recharts). Rather than reimplementing these in Rust, moron should provide a clean data pipeline from Rust scenes to custom React components, letting scene authors leverage the full npm ecosystem for rich visuals while moron handles timing, narration, and video output.

This story builds the bridge: a Rust→React data channel for arbitrary structured data, a plugin system for registering custom React components, and a proof-of-concept data-driven demo scene.

### DAG

```
T-013-01 → T-013-02 → T-013-03 → T-013-04
```

Linear chain — each layer builds on the previous. Data type enables registry, registry enables ecosystem integration, integration enables the demo.
