## Video Output Pipeline

Turn rendered frames into a finished .mp4 video. Integrate FFmpeg for H.264 encoding, assemble an audio track from timeline segments, and wire the full pipeline into `moron build`.

End goal: `moron build scene.rs -o output.mp4` produces a valid video file.

- FFmpeg process management and frame encoding
- Audio track assembly from timeline segment durations
- `moron build` CLI wiring
- End-to-end validation test
