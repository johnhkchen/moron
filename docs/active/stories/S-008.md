## Tech Debt Cleanup

Address accumulated tech debt across the codebase. All three tickets touch separate crates and can run in parallel.

- Convert AudioClip panic-based validation to Result-based error handling
- Fix clippy pedantic warnings in moron-techniques
- Remove unimplemented CLI placeholder commands
