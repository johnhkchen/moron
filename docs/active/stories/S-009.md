## Animation Engine & "What is moron?" Showcase

The rendering pipeline has all the pieces — techniques, timeline, frame computation, React renderer — but they aren't connected. Animation techniques are recorded on the timeline for pacing but their visual output is never applied to elements. Every visible element gets hardcoded `opacity: 1.0, scale: 1.0` regardless of what techniques were played. Elements all render dead-center on top of each other with no layout logic.

This story closes the loop: wire technique execution into frame rendering, add per-item animation state for Stagger, build a layout system for multi-element slides, and author a polished "What is moron?" explainer video that proves the engine works end-to-end.

### Tickets

| ID | Title | Depends On | Summary |
|----|-------|------------|---------|
| T-009-01 | animation-execution-engine | — | Store techniques + targets, compute progress, apply to elements |
| T-009-02 | per-item-animation-state | T-009-01 | Per-item transforms for Steps, wire Stagger.apply_item() |
| T-009-03 | element-layout-system | — | Position elements by kind/slide, not all centered |
| T-009-04 | what-is-moron-showcase | T-009-02, T-009-03 | Author polished explainer scene, end-to-end validation |

### DAG

```
T-009-01 ──→ T-009-02 ──→ T-009-04
                              ↑
T-009-03 ─────────────────────┘
```

T-009-01 and T-009-03 can run in parallel. T-009-02 chains off T-009-01. T-009-04 requires all three predecessors.
