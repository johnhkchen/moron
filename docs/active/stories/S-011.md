## Rich Showcase UI

The current MoronFrame React component renders elements with minimal inline styles — plain text on a flat background. The "What is moron?" video works but looks like a developer prototype, not a showcase. For the hello-world video to demonstrate what moron can produce, the UI layer needs depth: background gradients, accent colors, typographic hierarchy, spacing rhythm, and slide-level layout templates.

This story upgrades the React rendering layer from "functional proof" to "visually compelling default" so that the out-of-the-box experience looks professional without requiring custom CSS from scene authors.
