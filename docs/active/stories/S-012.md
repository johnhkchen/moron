## Pacing and Timing System

Current pacing has two problems: (1) content doesn't stay on screen long enough to read — `beat()` is 0.3s and `breath()` is 0.8s regardless of how much text is visible, and (2) titles and section headers hold for the same duration as body text even though they need far less reading time. The result is a video that feels rushed on content slides and sluggish on title cards.

This story adds content-aware pacing: hold durations that scale with text length, differentiated timing for titles vs body text, and a scene-author API for explicit hold control. The goal is video output where every element stays on screen exactly long enough to be read comfortably.

### Tickets

| ID | Title | Depends On | Summary |
|----|-------|------------|---------|
| T-012-01 | reading-time-model | — | Define a reading-speed model: WPM for body, fixed short holds for titles, minimum hold floor |
| T-012-02 | auto-hold-after-content | T-012-01 | Automatic hold duration inserted after element creation, scaled by content length |
| T-012-03 | hold-api-and-overrides | T-012-02 | m.hold() explicit API, per-element hold override, configurable reading speed |
| T-012-04 | apply-pacing-to-showcase | T-012-03 | Update what-is-moron scene with improved pacing, verify comfortable reading at 1x playback |

### DAG

```
T-012-01 → T-012-02 → T-012-03 → T-012-04
```

Linear chain — each ticket builds on the previous. Reading model informs auto-hold, which informs the API, which gets applied to the showcase.
