## Context

Integrate the Kokoro TTS engine for offline speech synthesis. Kokoro is an 82M parameter model running on CPU via ONNX runtime at ~96x real-time, using the kokorox Rust crate.

Implement a concrete TTS backend that:
1. Loads the Kokoro ONNX model (downloaded once, cached locally)
2. Takes text input and produces an AudioClip with synthesized speech
3. Implements the VoiceBackend trait pattern from moron-voice
4. Runs entirely offline — no network required after model download

The Voice struct in moron-voice already has backend_type variants for Kokoro and Piper. This ticket implements the Kokoro path.

Files: moron-voice/src/kokoro.rs (new), moron-voice/Cargo.toml (add kokorox/ort dependencies)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Can synthesize speech from text input using Kokoro
- Returns AudioClip with correct sample rate and duration
- Model loading with clear error if model files not found
- Works offline after initial model download
- Unit tests with mock/stub for CI (actual TTS gated behind #[ignore])
- `cargo check` passes
