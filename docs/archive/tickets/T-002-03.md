## Context

Define the voice/TTS backend abstraction in moron-voice. The architecture supports multiple TTS backends (Kokoro, Piper, API providers, pre-recorded audio) behind a common trait.

Define:
- `VoiceBackend` trait with methods: `synthesize(text: &str) -> AudioClip`, `name() -> &str`
- `AudioClip` struct: raw audio data + duration + sample rate
- `Voice` configuration struct: selects which backend to use, voice parameters (speed, pitch)
- `Voice::kokoro()`, `Voice::piper()`, `Voice::file(path)` constructor methods (stubs)
- Backend module stubs: kokoro.rs, piper.rs

Files: moron-voice/src/backend.rs, moron-voice/src/audio.rs, moron-voice/src/kokoro.rs, moron-voice/src/piper.rs, moron-voice/src/lib.rs

## Acceptance Criteria

- `VoiceBackend` trait defined with synthesize method
- `AudioClip` struct with duration and sample_rate fields
- `Voice` config struct with constructor methods
- `cargo check` passes
- Unit test: can construct a Voice config and AudioClip
