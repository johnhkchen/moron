## Context

Wire the packages/themes/ CSS custom properties into the rendering pipeline end-to-end. Verify that themes flow from Rust → JSON → React → rendered output correctly.

Currently, ThemeState contains CSS properties as key-value pairs and MoronFrame applies them as inline styles. This ticket ensures:
1. The default theme CSS from packages/themes/src/default.css is loaded in the host page
2. Theme switching works (different theme → different visual output)
3. All 56 CSS custom properties are correctly applied and cascade to template elements

Files: packages/themes/src/ (verify), packages/ui/src/host.tsx (import theme CSS), moron-themes/src/theme.rs (verify property generation)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Default theme CSS loaded in host page
- Theme properties from FrameState override defaults correctly
- Switching themes produces visually different output
- All moron-dark theme properties render correctly
- Integration test: render same frame with two themes, verify different output
- `cargo check` and `npm run typecheck` pass
