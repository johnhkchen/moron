## Frame Rendering Pipeline

Bridge the Rust timeline to visual output. Serialize frame state from the timeline at each timestamp, render it through React in headless Chromium, and capture screenshots as PNG frames.

This is the critical path from "data structures that describe a video" to "actual pixels on disk."

- Frame state serialization (timeline position → JSON props)
- React base component that renders frame state with CSS transforms
- Headless Chromium bridge via CDP for screenshot capture
- Frame rendering loop: iterate timeline at target FPS, output numbered PNGs
