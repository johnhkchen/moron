## Timeline & Animation Model

Implement the timeline data structure and core animation techniques. This is the heartbeat of moron — how visuals are sequenced over time. Pure Rust, no external dependencies required.

- Timeline with keyframes, segments, and time progression
- Core animation techniques (FadeIn, FadeUp, Slide, Scale, Stagger)
- Pacing primitives (beat, breath, wait)
- Unit tests for timeline progression and technique composition
