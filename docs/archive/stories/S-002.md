## Core Type System

Define the foundational Rust types across all crates that form the public API surface. These types will be used by scene files (via the M facade) and internally by the rendering pipeline.

- Scene trait and M facade with method signatures
- Technique trait with easing curves and composability
- Voice/TTS backend trait with audio clip types
- Theme struct with CSS property contract
- Wire all types together through the M facade
